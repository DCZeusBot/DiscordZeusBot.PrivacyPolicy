        Policy Regarding Discord Terms of Service Violations and Bot
        Blacklisting
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the event of a violation of the Discord Terms of Service (ToS)
        resulting in the blacklisting of your bot from your server, the
        following policies will be enforced:
      </p>

      <h3>Bot Blacklisting:</h3>
      <p>
        If your bot is found to be in violation of the Discord ToS, it will be
        promptly blacklisted from your server. This measure is taken to maintain
        the integrity of our platform and uphold community standards.
      </p>

      <h3>Premium Subscription Cancellation:</h3>
      <p>
        In the unfortunate event that your bot is blacklisted, any active
        premium subscriptions associated with it will be automatically canceled.
        This ensures that users are not paying for services rendered by a bot
        that is no longer compliant with Discord ToS.
      </p>

      <h3>Refund Policy:</h3>
      <p>
        We regret to inform you that refunds will not be provided under any
        circumstances. However, should you wish to terminate the premium
        subscription, we will expedite the cancellation process upon receiving a
        formal request. This ensures a seamless resolution for affected users.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Security Measures:</h3>
      <p>
        All user-related information, including names, email addresses,
        usernames, and user IDs, will be meticulously stored in a secure
        database. To fortify data security, the database password will undergo a
        weekly change, implementing a robust safeguard against potential
        breaches. In the event of a data breach, we will take immediate action
        to contact you and involve the appropriate authorities to prevent the
        sale of your data.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Stored Information:</h3>
      <p>
        All data we store will not be leaked to anyone and will not be viewed
        unless we need to take legal action:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will be able to contact you if a data breach occurs.</li>
        <li>
          If authorities need to view information for legal reasons, we may
          provide the necessary details but not more than required.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we need to take legal action, such as in cases of impersonation or
          law-breaking, we will use the stored information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Customer Support:</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of any issues or concerns, users have the right to contact
        our support team. We are committed to providing swift responses to
        ensure a timely resolution of any queries or problems that may arise.
